# InlineCRM System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for the InlineCRM system, including system architecture, user workflows, and module relationships.

## System Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high-level system architecture of InlineCRM:

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Web Client] --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> Auth[Auth Service]
    API --> Lead[Lead Management]
    API --> Analytics[Analytics Engine]
    
    Lead --> Enrich[Enrichment Service]
    Lead --> Qualify[Qualification Service]
    Lead --> Assign[Assignment Service]
    
    Enrich --> EnrichDB[(Enrichment DB)]
    Qualify --> QualifyDB[(Qualification DB)]
    Assign --> AssignDB[(Assignment DB)]
    
    Analytics --> AnalyticsDB[(Analytics DB)]
    
    class Client,API,Auth,Lead,Analytics,Enrich,Qualify,Assign primary
    class EnrichDB,QualifyDB,AssignDB,AnalyticsDB secondary
```

The system architecture follows a microservices approach, with distinct services handling core functionalities:
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all client requests
- **Auth Service**: Handles authentication and authorization
- **Lead Management**: Core service for lead processing
- **Analytics Engine**: Processes and analyzes lead data
- Supporting services include Enrichment, Qualification, and Assignment services

## User Workflows

The following diagram shows the lead processing workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant Enrichment
    participant Qualification
    participant Assignment

    User->>System: Submit Lead
    System->>Enrichment: Enrich Lead Data
    Enrichment-->>System: Return Enriched Data
    System->>Qualification: Score Lead
    Qualification-->>System: Return Lead Score
    System->>Assignment: Assign Lead
    Assignment-->>System: Return Assignment
    System-->>User: Display Lead Status
```

This workflow demonstrates the sequential processing of leads:
1. Lead submission by users
2. Automatic data enrichment
3. Lead scoring and qualification
4. Intelligent lead assignment
5. Status update to users

## Module Relationships

The following diagram shows the internal relationships between different modules:

```mermaid
graph LR
    LS[Lead Service] --> ES[Enrichment Service]
    LS --> QS[Qualification Service]
    LS --> AS[Assignment Service]
    LS --> ANS[Analytics Service]
    
    ES --> QS
    QS --> AS
    AS --> ANS
    
    subgraph Core Services
        LS
    end
    
    subgraph Supporting Services
        ES
        QS
        AS
    end
    
    subgraph Analytics
        ANS
    end
```

The module relationships highlight:
- Lead Service as the central orchestrator
- Dependencies between supporting services
- Analytics Service integration for data collection
- Clear separation of concerns between modules

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Service Development Priority**:
   - Lead Management Service (Core)
   - Enrichment Service
   - Qualification Service
   - Assignment Service
   - Analytics Service

2. **Database Considerations**:
   - Each service maintains its own database
   - Use event-driven architecture for cross-service communication
   - Implement data consistency patterns

3. **Security Measures**:
   - API Gateway authentication
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit

4. **Scalability Approach**:
   - Containerized deployment
   - Independent scaling of services
   - Cache implementation for frequently accessed data
